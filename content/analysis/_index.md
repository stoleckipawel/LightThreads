description: "Repeatable workflows for profiling, capture, and performance interpretation."

This section is for **repeatable workflows** (not one-off experiments).

Examples:

- How to capture a frame and answer “what is slow?”
- How to sanity-check bandwidth vs ALU bottlenecks
- How to structure GPU timing so results are comparable over time
