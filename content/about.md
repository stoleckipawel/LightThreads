**LightThreads** is a compact notebook for **engine design**, **GPU/CPU/memory profiling**, **PBR**, **ray tracing**, and **practical performance work**⚡

What I plan to write about:

- 🛠️ **Software engineering for rendering engines**: APIs, modular design, maintainability, and pragmatic release strategies.
- ⚙️ **Engine systems and trade-offs** for high-performance games and real-time applications.
- ⚡ **GPU-aware performance work**: memory layout, bandwidth vs compute trade-offs, batching, and caching.
- 🎨 **Physically based rendering and light transport**: useful patterns for PBR, sampling, and denoising.
- ✨ **Ray tracing pipelines**: getting quality where it matters without breaking the frame budget.
- 🔍 **Profiling, shader tuning**, and small tooling that makes performance work repeatable.

**About the author** 🙋‍♂️

**I’m Paweł Stołecki** — a 3D graphics software engineer focused on real‑time rendering. I enjoy the intersection where visual‑quality research meets hands‑on optimization: pushing shading closer to ground truth while keeping systems efficient and shippable. 🔬⚡

**At CD PROJEKT RED** — I work on direct & indirect lighting, cross‑platform GPU/CPU/memory profiling, and platform‑specific optimizations. My day‑to‑day is practical and investigative: experiment → measure → dig into what the hardware is actually doing → ship focused improvements. 🧪📈

**Previously:** Techland — contributed to gbuffer fill, lighting, post‑processing, and rendering scalability across many platforms (handhelds → consoles → high‑end). I began as a Technical Artist, which still shapes my emphasis on tooling, debuggability, and developer workflows. 🎮🛠️
